# ISAAC MSGS

This repo contains ROS message definitions used by ISAAC for communication over ROS.

Unless you are modifying the messages, you may not need to clone this repo directly and will probably consume this as a git submodule of another repo like the `isaac` repo.

## Backward compatibility

Message definition files that have a version number (e.g., `V1`) at the
end of their filename are "frozen" message types, as discussed in the
[telemetry backward compatibility
guide](https://nasa.github.io/astrobee/html/maintaining_telemetry.html).
These messages are no longer published by the latest software, but we
keep them for backward compatibility with archived ISS telemetry bags.

Examples include (definition: ISS activity relevance):

- `isaac_msgs/action/InspectionV1.action`: ISAAC1-2

- `isaac_msgs/action/InspectionV2.action`: ISAAC3

  - Note that the `actionlib` derived message types
    `InspectionV1ActionFeedback` and `InspectionV2ActionFeedback` happen
    to be identical, and we arbitrarily chose to rename
    `InspectionActionFeedback` to `InspectionV2ActionFeedback` for all
    activities ISAAC1-3.

- `isaac_msgs/msg/InspectionStateV1.msg`: ISAAC1-3
